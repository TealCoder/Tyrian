This will be a speed coding challenge: I'm gunna implement all the features I created over a couple months in highschool in an hour with my now pro-level java skilz. (I lost all the ugly, buggy code I made for this in HighSchool). Code coming soon... Also, I got to find a non-trademarked name.

Java script is a better idea; runs anywhere. Maybe I can get an input system that works on a phone.

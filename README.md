The first "complete" game I made in highschool using Java. Lost all the ugly buggy code when I learned that floppy disks go bad :-(.

Recreating it using the original images, in javascript to see if I can get back into the Joy of coding and learn to make games peeps can play on their phones. Adding sounds.
